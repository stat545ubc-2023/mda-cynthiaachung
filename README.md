**Cynthia Chung**

## Overview âœ¨
This is a mini-data analysis for the STAT 545A course at the University of British Columbia. The aim is to familiarize students with the logistics of performing analyses on unfamiliar semi-tidy datasets that is reproducible, clean, and coherent. For Milestone 1, the dataset *apt_buildings* was chosen for further exploration. For Milestone 2, further analysis was performed on *apt_buildings*.

README.md | A markdown file that provides an overview of the mini-data analysis assignment, as well as the files within the associated GitHub repository
milestone_1.md | A markdown file that contains an initial exploratory analysis required for Milestone 1. Though there were glimpses into multiple semi-tidy datasets, the majority of the analyis was done on the *apt_buildings* datasetâ€”courtesy of The City of Toronto's Open Data Portal. The contents of this is identical to that of "milestone_1.Rmd".
